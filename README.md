# Example API Guidelines

These [_Example API Guidelines_ are available in browsable form](guidelines/) (and [here are the sources they are generated from](src/)).

These guidelines are in no way complete. They are a snapshot and a demo for [Erik Wilde's presentation "Driving Digital Transformation
with an API Program"](http://dret.net/lectures/oreilly-sa-ny-2020/#culture) at the [O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2020 in New York, NY](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny).
