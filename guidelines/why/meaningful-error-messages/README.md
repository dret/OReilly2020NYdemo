# Meaningful Error Messages

### Make error messages easy to understand and provide information how to fix problems.

---

## Guideline Rationale:

Most APIs use styles where things can go wrong. The more helpful an API is in explaining what went wrong, and how a developer or user might be able to address the problem, the more easy the API is to use.

It is important to keep in mind that in case of error messages, a better Developer Experience (DX) with more helpful and clearly structured error messages directly translates into the possibility to create a better User Experience (UX). If the API only produces one generic error messages, that is the only thing that an application can display to the user. If, on the other hand, the error message is descriptive and machine-understandable, applications can at the very least display more meaningful error messages, and ideally even implement behavior that mitigates the effects of the error.
