- [Provide Service Descriptions](why/service-description/ "Provide machine-readable descriptions of APIs for tooling and automation.")
- [Provide Service Documentation](why/service-documentation/ "Provide service documentation that is appropriate for the maturity of the API and the intended audience.")
